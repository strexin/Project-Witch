# Project-Witch
A mini open world game where the player plays as a witch. A resource gathering game where you collect various mushrooms and other resources from the woods to concoct a poison and then sell it to the villagers in need. Use the money you get from selling the potion to pay your house credit and live peacefully. This project is still ongoing, and all things that I developed will be updated in this repository.

In this project, I'm planning to focus more on the technical side, such as performance and how I manage the code to keep it clean, scalable, and readable.

I will also update the project details on my portfolio page: https://strexin.wordpress.com
